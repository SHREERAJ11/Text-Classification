# Text Classification using TensorFlow

This repository contains code for text classification using TensorFlow, focusing on sentiment analysis of movie reviews from the IMDb dataset.

<h2>Dataset</h2>


The IMDb dataset consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative sentiment. It's preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets.

<h2>Usage</h2>


    Clone this repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/shreeraj11/text-classification-tensorflow.git

  git clone https://github.com/shreeraj11/text-classification-tensorflow.git

<h2>Models</h2>


We implement a text classification model using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub for word embeddings. The model architecture consists of an embedding layer followed by dense layers.

<h2>Results</h2>


After training the model, we achieve an accuracy of approximately 94.4% on the test set.
